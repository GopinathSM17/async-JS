  "WHAT IS LOREM IPSUM?",
  "LOREM IPSUM IS SIMPLY DUMMY TEXT OF THE PRINTING AND TYPESETTING INDUSTRY.",
  "LOREM IPSUM HAS BEEN THE INDUSTRY'S STANDARD DUMMY TEXT EVER SINCE THE 1500S,\nWHEN AN UNKNOWN PRINTER TOOK A GALLEY OF TYPE AND SCRAMBLED IT TO MAKE A TYPE SPECIMEN BOOK.",
  "IT HAS SURVIVED NOT ONLY FIVE CENTURIES, BUT ALSO THE LEAP INTO ELECTRONIC TYPESETTING,\nREMAINING ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED.",
  "IT WAS POPULARISED IN THE 1960S WITH THE RELEASE OF LETRASET SHEETS\nCONTAINING LOREM IPSUM PASSAGES, AND MORE RECENTLY WITH DESKTOP PUBLISHING SOFTWARE LIKE ALDUS PAGEMAKER\nINCLUDING VERSIONS OF LOREM IPSUM.",
  "WHY DO WE USE IT?",
  "IT IS A LONG ESTABLISHED FACT THAT A READER WILL BE\nDISTRACTED BY THE READABLE CONTENT OF A PAGE WHEN LOOKING AT ITS LAYOUT.",
  "THE POINT OF USING LOREM IPSUM\nIS THAT IT HAS A MORE-OR-LESS NORMAL DISTRIBUTION OF LETTERS, AS OPPOSED TO USING 'CONTENT HERE, CONTENT\nHERE', MAKING IT LOOK LIKE READABLE ENGLISH.",
  "MANY DESKTOP PUBLISHING PACKAGES AND WEB PAGE EDITORS NOW\nUSE LOREM IPSUM AS THEIR DEFAULT MODEL TEXT, AND A SEARCH FOR 'LOREM IPSUM' WILL UNCOVER MANY WEB SITES\nSTILL IN THEIR INFANCY.",
  "VARIOUS VERSIONS HAVE EVOLVED OVER THE YEARS, SOMETIMES BY ACCIDENT, SOMETIMES\nON PURPOSE (INJECTED HUMOUR AND THE LIKE).",
  "WHERE DOES IT COME FROM?",
  "CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF, LOREM\nIPSUM IS NOT SIMPLY RANDOM TEXT.",
  "IT HAS ROOTS IN A PIECE OF CLASSICAL LATIN LITERATURE FROM 45 BC, MAKING\nIT OVER 2000 YEARS OLD.",
  "RICHARD MCCLINTOCK, A LATIN PROFESSOR AT HAMPDEN-SYDNEY COLLEGE IN VIRGINIA,\nLOOKED UP ONE OF THE MORE OBSCURE LATIN WORDS, CONSECTETUR, FROM A LOREM IPSUM PASSAGE, AND GOING THROUGH\nTHE CITES OF THE WORD IN CLASSICAL LITERATURE, DISCOVERED THE UNDOUBTABLE SOURCE.",
  "LOREM IPSUM COMES FROM\nSECTIONS 1.10.32 AND 1.10.33 OF \"DE FINIBUS BONORUM ET MALORUM\" (THE EXTREMES OF GOOD AND EVIL) BY CICERO,\nWRITTEN IN 45 BC.",
  "THIS BOOK IS A TREATISE ON THE THEORY OF ETHICS, VERY POPULAR DURING THE RENAISSANCE.",
  "THE FIRST LINE OF LOREM IPSUM, \"LOREM IPSUM DOLOR SIT AMET..\", COMES FROM A LINE IN SECTION 1.10.32.",
  "THE STANDARD CHUNK OF LOREM IPSUM USED SINCE THE 1500S IS REPRODUCED BELOW FOR THOSE INTERESTED.",
  "SECTIONS 1.10.32 AND 1.10.33 FROM \"DE FINIBUS BONORUM ET MALORUM\" BY CICERO ARE ALSO REPRODUCED IN\nTHEIR EXACT ORIGINAL FORM, ACCOMPANIED BY ENGLISH VERSIONS FROM THE 1914 TRANSLATION BY H.",
  "RACKHAM.",
  "WHERE CAN I GET SOME?",
  "THERE ARE MANY VARIATIONS OF PASSAGES OF LOREM IPSUM AVAILABLE, BUT THE MAJORITY\nHAVE SUFFERED ALTERATION IN SOME FORM, BY INJECTED HUMOUR, OR RANDOMISED WORDS WHICH DON'T LOOK EVEN\nSLIGHTLY BELIEVABLE.",
  "IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE A PASSAGE OF LOREM IPSUM, YOU NEED TO BE SURE THERE ISN'T\nANYTHING EMBARRASSING HIDDEN IN THE MIDDLE OF TEXT.",
  "ALL THE LOREM IPSUM GENERATORS ON THE INTERNET TEND\nTO REPEAT PREDEFINED CHUNKS AS NECESSARY, MAKING THIS THE FIRST TRUE GENERATOR ON THE INTERNET.",
  "IT USES A DICTIONARY OF OVER 200 LATIN WORDS, COMBINED WITH A HANDFUL OF MODEL SENTENCE STRUCTURES,\nTO GENERATE LOREM IPSUM WHICH LOOKS REASONABLE.",
  "THE GENERATED LOREM IPSUM IS THEREFORE ALWAYS FREE FROM\nREPETITION, INJECTED HUMOUR, OR NON-CHARACTERISTIC WORDS ETC."
